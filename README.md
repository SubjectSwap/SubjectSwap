# SubjectSwap

## Description
SubjectSwap is a web application that allows students to swap their subjects with each other. The application is designed to help students who are struggling with a particular subject to find someone who is struggling with a different subject and can help them out. The application also allows students to create a profile and add their subjects of interest, so that other students can find them and swap subjects with them.
